/*
Numan_library. Including 
1. Is any key pressed (can input blob or CControls) Is any mouse button pressed. etc.
2. Input an array of control enums to check if any are pressed.
4. Is string a 0 or 1 (outputs bool if is not a 0 or 1). takes in a referenced bool, changes it to true or falsed based on the inputted string
5. Put string array into one big string.
6. Easy on command method/function. Make it possible to send around things via methods and without using onCommand stuff. only CBitStream.
7. Easy way to display contents of array. Make a bunch of methods for each datatype, printing all of them out.
8. Get all players in array, arrange from closest to furthest (only if they have blobs). (CommandChat.as)
8.5 Sort an array of blobs by distance. Include optional team parameter (CommandChat.as)
8.75 Sort array of Vectors
9. Enum array of every KEY_CODE
10. Is block above? check every block above and check if it is the requested one. return true or false.
11. Is block below? 
12. Is block left?
13. Is block right?(maybe merge into one with a directional parameter)
#14. Send chat message to player (CommandChat.as)
#15. Send chat message to all players 
#17. Get player associated with id.
#18. Time since map loaded.
#19. Get blocks in radius. (blocky radius, jagged array of blocks)
#20. Get if there are blocks between two given points. optional "give" value that effectively shrinks the size of all the blocks corners. (it's a quality of life thing)
#21. Get quantity of items in inventory. (say you have 250 wood and 125 wood. It gets them all and adds them together.)
#22. Get spawn locations for specified team.
#23. Transfer over health, items, position between two blobs. Return the new blob. Give option for both name of blob, and CBlob. Also can give CPlayer provided you want that automatically changed.
#24. Angle difference.
#25. Apply force in direction. this.AddForce(Vec2f(this.isFacingLeft() ? -velocity * Maths::Sin(angle) : velocity * Maths::Cos(angle), this.isFacingLeft() ? -velocity * Maths::Cos(angle) : velocity * Maths::Sin(angle))); Would this work?


DrawTextWithWidth(string text, Vec2f pos, SColor color, float width) - Caps width, note this will require an array to save draw text stuff as the calculations should not be done every render call.
