Load font image on demand rather than having to do it beforehand?
Test to see if the freeze for a moment is bothersome.
Also figure out what exactly is causing the freeze, and how to lessen it.



Fake pickup blob.
One blob that teleports around. based on positions it is assigned to. These positions are for example, fake blobs; things that aren't blobs that can be picked up.
Upon being picked up, it tells the fake blob that it was picked up. And it drops itself.

Lite CBlob class. CBlob but with very few things. CSprite and CShape are avaliable for use but not required. an option is avaliable to use something custom to render such as NuImage instead of a CSprite. 
(funcdef to the render function)
Single CBlob spawned in that handles every single Lite CBlob. such as OnCommand, ticking and rendering. Using CRules to do it could get it filled up with too many commands. something something performance.
Use hashed Lite CBlob name to filter through where the command should be sent.
remember, every Lite CBlob should not have all of its methods inside its class. Otherwise each Lite CBlob would contain a identical copy of all of their things.
Rather, there should something like a base class that calls hooks and stores varaibles. This base class should not be changed by the modder or inherited by another class. Every Lite CBlob 
?? each class holds a pointer to another class that holds functions relating to the specific blob.
To try and make things more clear:
Lite CBlob Base 
{
    Contains variables and standard functions
    {
        Health
        CSprite
        CShape
        ?CPlayer?
        ?CControls?
        ?CAttachment?
        ?CBrain?
        Pos, OldPos, InterpolatedPos, Velocity. (functions to get the position on screen instead of in the world.)
        Angle, Angle Velocity
        Visible (Is the render function called?)
        Active (Is onTick & Render function called?)
        Facing Left.
        NetworkID
        TeamNum
        BlobName BlobNameHash
        Ticks since created
        Kill
        Set time to die.
        
        SendCommand (function calls Lite CBlob Functions send command?)
    }
    Contains a pointer to Lite CBlob Functions.
    Created for every new blob.
    Every time this is created with a name, it looks through all Lite CBlob Function's names and adds the pointer to the matching one.
    Dictionary to work like this.set_u8 whatever. Along with a .sync() command to sync to sync to server/client. Also a sync to a specific player command.
    
}
Lite CBlob Functions (Inherit this class and override functions) 
{
    Static, only one should ever exist.
    Blob Count
    is client only, server only, or client and server. The Lite CBlob class can function on only client, only server, or sync between the two. The parameter here changes how that works.

    onInit
    onTick
    onDie
    onCommand
    onHealthChange(CBlob@, f32 OldHealth, CParams@)
    
}
